<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
You are a senior product designer + frontend engineer building a premium B2B SaaS website for an AI-first contract review company called “Lawvek”.

**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:**
- **Design:** The design has evolved from a minimal light theme to a premium dark theme, and now to a **premium light theme** featuring an interactive network background, layered hero section, and a mix of light and dark sections. The user has a strong focus on a premium, royal, and lively aesthetic.
- **Tech Stack:** Next.js (App Router), Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion.
- **Structure (One-Page Landing):**
    1. Hero Section: Includes layered depth effects and an interactive background with an invisible shield for text readability.
    2. Trust Ticker: A redesigned light-themed ticker.
    3. Problem Section
    4. The Lawvek Approach / Solution Section
    5. Benefits Grid
    6. Integrations Section
    7. CTA Section
    8. Footer
- **Key Features:**
    - An interactive network/dot background that reacts to cursor movement, confined to the Hero section.
    - A premium floating header design.
- **Recent User Requests:**
    - The user reported the website animation was slow and stopping. An attempt to optimize it by changing the hero animation was rejected. The user wants the original, visually rich hero animation restored, and the performance issue fixed without altering the hero section's look.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
A single-page, frontend-only Next.js application for Lawvek. The agent has performed significant iterative design work on the Hero Section, Header, and Trust Ticker based on user feedback to achieve a premium and royal light theme. A major performance issue was identified by the user (slow and stopping). The agent's first attempt to fix this involved simplifying the hero animation, which the user rejected. The current state is that the agent is about to revert the performance fix to restore the original, more complex hero animation.

**Last working item**:
    - Last item agent was working: Reverting the performance optimizations made to . The user was unhappy that the hero section animation was changed in the process of fixing site-wide performance issues and explicitly requested to restore it to its previous state. The agent was in the process of restoring the original file content.
    - Status: IN PROGRESS
    - Agent Testing Done: N
    - Which testing method agent to use? screenshot tool. After reverting, the agent must take a screenshot of the hero section to confirm the visuals have been restored to the state the user approved.
    - User Testing Done: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
  - Issue 1: Page animation is slow and laggy. (Priority: P0)
  - Issue 2: Frontend application instability during development. (Priority: P2)

  Issues Detail:
  - Issue 1:
     - Attempted fixes: The agent tried to fix this by simplifying the  animation (reducing particle count, removing shadows) and restricting it to the hero section. This fix was **rejected by the user** because it altered the visual quality of the hero animation. The immediate next step is to revert this change.
     - Next debug checklist:
        1. **Revert** the changes in  to restore the original animation.
        2. **Confirm** with the user that the hero section visuals are correct.
        3. **Re-address performance:** Investigate alternative optimization strategies that do not alter the hero animation's visual fidelity. Suggestions: offload canvas rendering to a Web Worker, use  on expensive components, or further optimize the animation logic without visual changes.
     - Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix? The site currently provides a poor user experience due to lag. Fixing this will make the site feel smooth, professional, and truly premium as requested.
     - Status: IN PROGRESS
     - Is recurring issue? Y
     - Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix? frontend
     - Blocked on other issue: None.
  - Issue 2:
     - Attempted fixes: None in this session. A previous agent reverted changes to temporarily fix it, but the root cause remains.
     - Next debug checklist: Review component import strategy in  and component barrel files. Standardize on a single, consistent import pattern. Lint the frontend code.
     - Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix? To stabilize the development environment and prevent future runtime crashes from simple code changes.
     - Status: NOT STARTED
     - Is recurring issue? Y
     - Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix? frontend
     - Blocked on other issue: None

**In progress Task List**:
  - Task 1: Revert  to its pre-optimization state. (Priority: P0)

 Task Detail:
  - Task 1:
     - Where to resume: The agent has identified the file to revert (). The next step is to use the  tool to replace the current optimized code with the previous, more complex version from chat history.
     - What will be achieved with this? This will satisfy the user's immediate request to restore the look and feel of the hero section animation.
     - Status: IN PROGRESS
     - Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix? frontend
     - Blocked on something: None.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
    Upcoming Tasks:
    - (P0) **Re-solve Performance Issue**: After reverting the hero animation, tackle the slow and stopping animation issue again with a new, non-visual-degrading approach (e.g., Web Workers).
    - (P1) **User Verification of Logo Fix**: The logo correction from the previous fork was never formally approved by the user. The next agent should confirm this.
    - (P2) **Refactor **: Refactor the component to source SVGs from a separate configuration file or as imported components, rather than having them hardcoded.

**Completed work in this session**
- List of all completed tasks with file and method name:
  - **Hero Section Visual Enhancement**: Iteratively redesigned the  component to have a lively and royal feel with a flowing gradient, richer colors (gold, royal blue), and more prominent particles/lines.
  - **Hero Section Readability Shield**: Implemented an invisible shield in  that repels particles and lines from the central text area, ensuring readability. Adjusted shield size based on user feedback.
  - **Header Redesign**: Performed multiple redesigns of , moving from a full-width strip to a premium, floating glass-morphism pill for the navigation. Aligned all header elements for a balanced, premium look.
  - **Trust Ticker Redesign**: Updated  by removing its dark background, replacing text, and adding gold accents to align with the site's light, premium theme.

- Recently completed:
  - Header visual refinement and CTA text correction. (DONE)
  - Trust Ticker redesign to be more prominent and premium. (DONE)
  - Hero section invisible shield implementation. (DONE)

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
   - **Issue 1**: The application instability due to fragile component imports, mentioned in the initial handoff, was not addressed. (See All Pending/In progress Issue list).

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
  - **Issue recurrence in previous fork**: Incorrect company logos in Integrations Section.
  - **Recurrence count**: At least 4 times.
  - **Status**: RESOLVED (but pending user verification).

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
- **Frontend:** React, Next.js (App Router)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **Animations:** Framer Motion, HTML5 Canvas API () for the interactive background.
- **Performance:** The need for performance optimization (e.g., Web Workers, code splitting) is now a critical concept for this project.

**key DB schema**
  - N/A (No database)

**changes in tech stack**
  - None.

**All files of reference**
- : The central file for the current issue. Needs to be reverted, then re-optimized.
- : Recently redesigned header.
- : Recently redesigned ticker.
- : Main application entry point.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
- **:** This component is large, complex, and performance-intensive. It urgently needs refactoring for both maintainability and performance, possibly by offloading the animation logic to a Web Worker.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- **User Priority:** The user is highly focused on aesthetics and a premium feel. They will reject functional improvements if they degrade the visual quality.
- **Immediate Task:** Your first action MUST be to revert the changes to  to restore the hero animation to the state the user previously approved. Do not attempt any new optimizations until this is done and confirmed.
- **The Core Problem:** After the revert, the original performance issue (slow and stopping) will still exist. The main challenge of the next session will be to solve this performance problem *without* altering the visual appearance of the hero animation.
- **User Verification Pending:** The logo fix from the previous fork has not been acknowledged or approved by the user. This should be brought up after the immediate performance/revert task is handled.

**documents and test reports created in this job**
  - None. The previous report  exists but is not from this session.

**Last 10 User Messages and any pending HUMAN messages**
1. **Latest**: User states they don't want any change in the hero page animation, lines, or dots, and that everything else in the performance fix was okay. (Status: Agent is acting on this by reverting).
2. User reports the webpage and animation are slow and stopping and asks for a smoother, lighter experience without changing the design. (Status: Initial fix rejected, new fix needed).
3. User asks to make the Trust Ticker more prominent, smoother, and bolder. (Status: Completed).
4. User requests the removal of the dark background and specific text from the Trust Ticker. (Status: Completed).
5. User requests to reduce the opacity of lines in other sections (Benefits, Security) for a premium feel. (Status: Completed, then reverted due to performance impact).
6. User approves the header design after several iterations, asking for it to be more translucent with a premium hover effect. (Status: Completed).
7. User rejects a header design, stating it looks misaligned. (Status: Addressed in a subsequent iteration).
8. User rejects another header design, calling it a school project feel and asking for a more premium, floating look. (Status: Addressed in a subsequent iteration).
9. User asks for the invisible shield in the hero section to be reduced in size slightly. (Status: Completed).
10. User asks for the invisible shield to be larger to cover all text. (Status: Completed).

**Project Health Check:**
- **Mocked**: The application has significant visual polish but suffers from a critical performance issue that makes the user experience poor. The project is blocked on resolving this performance issue without compromising the user-approved design.

**3rd Party Integrations**
- **framer-motion**
- **lucide-react**

**Testing status**
  - Testing agent used after significant changes: NO
  - Troubleshoot agent used after agent stuck in loop: NO
  - Test files created: []
  - Known regressions: Performance degradation after adding complex animations.

**Credentials to test flow:**
N/A

**What agent forgot to execute**
- The agent did not get the user's final verification for the logo fix from the previous session.
- The agent did not address the underlying frontend instability issue mentioned in the initial handoff.
- The agent did not start the session with a holistic plan via , instead jumping directly into the user's first design request. This led to a long chain of iterative design changes without addressing underlying technical debt.</analysis>
