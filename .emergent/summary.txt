    - Ensure all Get Priority Access buttons are uniform in style.
    - Numerous iterative design changes to achieve a premium, classy, and enterprise-grade feel.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
A single-page, frontend-only Next.js application for Lawvek. The site is component-based using React, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, and lucide-react for icons. The development has been highly iterative, focusing on achieving a premium UI/UX. Recently, the Hero section and Header were completely redesigned to a dark, centered theme, while the rest of the page remains on the original light theme, creating a design inconsistency. A spots left counter feature, which increments on form submission and persists in localStorage, has also been implemented.

**Last working item**:
    - Last item agent was working: The user requested to update the entire website to match the new dark theme of the hero section for a uniform look and feel. The agent acknowledged the request and was about to start implementing the thematic overhaul across all page sections.
    - Status: NOT STARTED
    - Agent Testing Done: N
    - Which testing method agent to use? screenshot tool (to verify the new theme consistency across all sections).
    - User Testing Done: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
  - Issue 1: Inconsistent website theme. The Hero section has a dark, centered design, while the remaining sections (, , etc.) have the old light-themed design, creating a jarring experience. (Priority: P0)

     - Status: NOT STARTED
     - Is recurring issue? N
     - Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix? frontend
     - Blocked on other issue: None

**In progress Task List**:
  - Task 1: Unify Website Theme to Dark Mode

     - Status: NOT STARTED
     - Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix? frontend
     - Blocked on something: None

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
   - The project is in a phase of heavy iterative design refinement. The next agent should anticipate more visual polish requests rather than new feature builds. The primary focus is on aesthetics.

**Completed work in this session**
- **Complete Hero Section Redesign (Dark Theme):**
  - Based on a user-provided image, the hero section was rebuilt with a dark background overlay, centered text, a white CTA, and an amber Lawyer Assisted AI badge.  was completely rewritten.
- **Adaptive Header:**
  - The header in  was updated to be adaptive, showing a white logo and text on the dark hero background and transitioning to dark text on a sticky white background upon scrolling.
- **Urgency & Scarcity Feature:**
  - Implemented a dynamic counter in  and  to show spots left for early access, derived from a base number and stored in .
  - The  form submission now increments the counter.
  - The text No credit card required was removed and replaced with the urgency indicator.
- **Button Unification:**
  - Standardized all Get Priority Access buttons across the site (, , ) to a consistent pill shape with a shimmer hover effect.
  - Removed the secondary Watch Demo button from .
- **Hero Section Simplification:**
  - Iteratively removed a complex, colorful product card and then a simpler pricing card, replacing them with a clean list of trust indicators (e.g., SOC 2 Type II certified) with checkmark icons to de-clutter the view and focus on the main CTA.
- **Approach Section Refinement:**
  - Redesigned the three feature boxes in  to be uniform in structure, text length, and styling, resolving issues with alignment and inconsistent spacing.
- **Data Consistency:**
  - Corrected factual inconsistencies, ensuring metrics like turnaround time were the same across all sections.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
   - None. All issues raised by the user during the session were addressed through iterative design changes.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
  - None.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
- **Frontend:** React, Next.js (App Router)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS, custom animations in  (e.g., shimmer effect).
- **Animations:** Framer Motion
- **State Management:** React hooks (, ) and  for persisting the queue counter.
- **Architecture:** Component-based, single-page application. No backend.

**key DB schema**
  - N/A (No database)

**changes in tech stack**
  - None.

**All files of reference**
- : The template for the new dark theme.
- : Contains logic for the adaptive dark/light theme header.
- : Manages the global state for the spots left counter.
- : Contains custom CSS for button hover effects and other global styles.
- : The first section that needs a theme update.
- : Another key section requiring a theme update.
- : Contains the form that interacts with the counter.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
- **Thematic Refactoring:** The entire application, on a component-by-component basis, needs to be refactored to adopt the new dark theme. This is the main pending task.
- : Has become complex with state logic for the form and success message.
- : Contains scroll-based theme-switching logic which could be complex to maintain.

**key api endpoints**
- N/A

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- **Priority #1 is Thematic Unification:** Your immediate and most critical task is to apply the dark theme from the Hero Section to every other section of the website. The user expects a consistent, premium look.
- **The user is the designer:** The user drives the design process with highly specific, iterative feedback, often with image references. Be prepared to make many small visual tweaks until the user is satisfied.
- **The aesthetic is dark, premium, enterprise:** All new designs and modifications must align with this. Use the new  as your style guide.
- **Functionality is secondary to design right now:** While functionality like the modal and counter must work, the user's primary focus is on visual appeal.

**Last 10 User Messages and any pending HUMAN messages**
1.  **User (msg 183):** Requested to change the CTA button shape back to the earlier pill shape and improve the spots left styling for urgency. (Completed)
2.  **User (msg 197):** Stated the hero section was too cluttered and requested removal of the pricing card to make the main CTA the focus, suggesting simple trust indicators with tick icons instead. (Completed)
3.  **User (msg 209):** Provided a reference image with a dark, centered layout and asked the agent to apply that style to the hero section while keeping the current text content. (Completed)
4.  **User (msg 225):** **(LATEST/BLOCKER)** After seeing the new dark hero section, the user asked to make the color palette and theme of the entire page uniform to match it. (Not Started)

**Project Health Check:**
- **Broken**: The website theme is inconsistent. The top of the page (Hero) is dark, while the rest is light, resulting in a broken and unprofessional user experience.

**3rd Party Integrations**
- **framer-motion**: Used for UI animations (e.g., hover effects, page transitions).
- **lucide-react**: Used for icons throughout the application.

**Testing status**
  - Testing agent used after significant changes: NO (The session involved rapid, purely visual iterations, which were verified with the screenshot tool).
  - Troubleshoot agent used after agent stuck in loop: NO
  - Test files created: []
  - Known regressions: None.

**Credentials to test flow:**
N/A

**What agent forgot to execute**
- The agent has been following the user's explicit instructions very closely. The current pending task is a direct consequence of the user's latest design direction and not an oversight.</analysis>
